# Hive Helsinki project
"Itâ€™s your turn today to modelize in 3D some magnificent landscapes, imaginary or not..."
This is the first project in the graphics branch. We had to make a program which displays
different maps. I also made some easy bonuses, such as a zoom feature. If you want to test my program,
you should have access to miniLibX. Have fun!
